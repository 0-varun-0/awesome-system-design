### Introduction / Interviews 

- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) [109k ‚≠ê] - Awesome compilation of resources, including Anki flashcard decks.

- [System Design Interview Questions - Concepts you should know](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/systems-design-for-interviews/) - A curated list of topics to introduce you to system design.

- [Grokking the System Design Interview (PAID)](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) - Grokking System Design preparation is one of the most talked about course. The best thing about it is the design of applications it suggests rather than explanations of what each tool is supposed to do.

- [System Design in Software Development](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/system-design-in-software-development-f360ce6fcbb9) - Basic article on the topics of system design and architecture.

- [Everything you need to know about Design System](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) - Another introductory article written in a friendly way.

- [System Design](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/system-design/) - Introductory interview preparation resources

- [Design Pattern for Distributed Systems](https://www.codemag.com/Article/1909071/Design-Patterns-for-Distributed-Systems) - Article talking about some patterns as well as some technologies to be considered.
